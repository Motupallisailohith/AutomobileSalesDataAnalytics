Here's a brief `README.md` for your "Automobile Sales Data Analysis" project:



# Automobile Sales Data Analysis

A comprehensive project for analyzing and predicting used car prices through data cleaning, EDA, market trend analysis, and machine learning.

## Description

This project processes automobile sales data to uncover insights into pricing dynamics, market trends, and seller performance. [cite\_start]It involves cleaning raw data, performing various statistical and exploratory analyses, and building a machine learning model to predict car selling prices[cite: 5, 6].

## Key Features

  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and data type inconsistencies
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes distributions, correlations, and identifies initial patterns.
  Market Analysis: Compares prices across makes, models, and assesses the impact of car condition.
  Seller Performance Analysis: Evaluates sellers based on average selling prices and sales volumes.
  Time Series Analysis: Identifies trends and seasonal patterns in sales data.
  Feature Engineering: Creates new features like `car_age` and `mileage_per_year`.
  Price Prediction: Trains a TensorFlow deep learning model to predict car selling prices with high accuracy.
  Interactive Data Filtering: Allows users to classify and filter data subsets.

## Tools & Technologies

  * Python: Core programming language.
  * Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization.
  * Scikit-learn: Data preprocessing, clustering, and metrics.
  * TensorFlow: Machine learning model training and feature importance.
  * Statsmodels: Time series analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  Python 3.8+ [cite: 916]
  * Git
  * Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/automobile-sales-data-analysis.git
    cd automobile-sales-data-analysis
    ```
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
    # On macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow statsmodels joblib
    ```

### How to Run

Execute the Python scripts in sequence from the `src/` directory. For example:

1.  Clean Data: `python src/Data_cleaning_and_preprocess.py`
2.  Perform EDA: `python src/EDA.py`
3.  Train Price Prediction Model: `python src/price_prediction_model_traning.py`

## Architecture & Results

 The project generates various plots illustrating data distributions, correlations, market trends, and model performance. [cite\_start]Key findings include the strong correlation between selling price and MMR (0.98) [cite: 280][cite\_start], and the model's high accuracy (RÂ² of 0.978)[cite: 848].
